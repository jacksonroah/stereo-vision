# Stereo Vision Biomechanical Tracking System
Project Status Update - May 16, 2025

## Current Focus: Motion Smoothing Implementation

Based on today's analysis, we've determined that Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering represents the optimal approach for addressing current jitter and unrealistic movement issues in our tracking system. This will be our primary focus for the next development phase.

### Motion Smoothing Strategy

1. **Filter Selection**: Savitzky-Golay filters have been selected as our primary smoothing technique due to their superior ability to preserve important biomechanical features while removing noise.

2. **Implementation Approach**: 
   - Create a dedicated `motion_smoothing.py` module
   - Add configuration parameters for filter window size and polynomial order
   - Implement feature flags to allow toggling between filter types (SG, One-Euro, Moving Average)

3. **Parameter Optimization**:
   - For iPhone footage (30 fps): Window size 7-9, polynomial order 2
   - For future iPhone tests (60 fps): Window size 11-15, polynomial order 3
   - For Edgertronics (480 fps): Window size 21-31, polynomial order 3-4

### Camera Configuration for Edgertronics

1. **Genlock Configuration**: Will utilize genlock capabilities to ensure perfect synchronization between cameras, simplifying the temporal alignment process.

2. **Resolution & Frame Rate**:
   - Calibration videos: 1080p at 120 fps
   - Motion capture: 1080p at 480 fps
   - Exposure: 1/1000s - 1/3000s based on movement speed

3. **Camera Positioning**:
   - 90Â° angle between cameras for optimal triangulation
   - For pitching: One camera behind pitcher, one perpendicular (side view)
   - 3-4 meter separation between cameras

### Development Roadmap

1. **Immediate Next Steps**:
   - Implement SG filtering in motion_smoothing.py
   - Integrate with existing 3dpose.py using modular approach
   - Validate improvement through comparison of filtered vs. unfiltered outputs

2. **Near-Term Goals**:
   - Complete validation via controlled biomechanical tests
   - Implement force calculation capabilities
   - Prepare for box jump validation test with force plate

3. **Source Code Management**:
   - Implement Git repository structure with data exclusion
   - Maintain version history and development documentation
   - Separate core algorithms from application-specific modules

### Technical Insights & Principles

1. **Differentiation Strategy**: Using SG filters will allow more reliable velocity and acceleration calculations by preserving higher moments in the data while removing noise.

2. **Validation Approach**: Rather than complex object tracking, we'll focus on human-based validation using standardized movements and comparison against biomechanical norms.

3. **Filter Comparison**:
   - SG Filters: Best for preserving important biomechanical features while removing noise
   - One-Euro: Better for real-time applications with variable smoothing
   - Moving Average: Simplest but introduces lag and dampens important features

4. **Data Management**: Raw video data will be stored separately from code, with clear documentation connecting specific datasets to code versions.

## Long-Term Vision

The refined motion tracking system will provide the foundation for biomechanical force and power analysis, culminating in a comprehensive validation against force plate measurements. Once validated, the system will enable specialized biomechanical analysis for specific sports and movements, starting with pitching mechanics.
